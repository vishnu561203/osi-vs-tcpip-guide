----------------------
OSI Model ;- 
Meaning; - The OSI Model stands for Open Systems Interconnection Model. It is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how data is transmitted over a network.
The OSI model has 7 layers, each with a specific function:

ðŸ”¢ OSI 7 Layers (from top to bottom):
1.	Application Layer
â€“ User interaction (e.g., web browsers, email)
â€“ Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP
2.	Presentation Layer
â€“ Data format, encryption, compression
â€“ Converts data to a format the application can understand
3.	Session Layer
â€“ Manages sessions between devices (start, manage, end sessions)
4.	Transport Layer
â€“ Ensures reliable data transfer (e.g., error checking, data sequencing)
â€“ Protocols: TCP, UDP
5.	Network Layer
â€“ Routing and IP addressing
â€“ Protocol: IP
6.	Data Link Layer
â€“ Transfers data between two directly connected nodes
â€“ Handles MAC addresses, switches
7.	Physical Layer
â€“ Physical connection (cables, electrical signals, etc.)

TCP/IP Model; - 
The TCP/IP Model is a set of networking protocols that allows computers to communicate over the internet. It has four layers, each responsible for specific functions like data transmission, routing, and communication between applications.
â€¢  Application Layer â€“ interacts with user applications (e.g., HTTP, DNS).
â€¢  Transport Layer â€“ ensures reliable data transfer (e.g., TCP, UDP).
â€¢  Internet Layer â€“ routes data across networks (e.g., IP).
â€¢  Network Interface Layer â€“ manages hardware and physical data transfer (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).


âœ… Difference Between OSI Model and TCP/IP Model

1. Full Form
â€¢	OSI: Open Systems Interconnection
â€¢	TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol
________________________________________
2. Number of Layers
â€¢	OSI: 7 Layers
â€¢	TCP/IP: 4 Layers
________________________________________
3. Developed By
â€¢	OSI: International Standards Organization (ISO)
â€¢	TCP/IP: U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
________________________________________
4. Usage
â€¢	OSI: Mainly a theoretical reference model
â€¢	TCP/IP: Used in real-world networking like the Internet
________________________________________
5. Layer Structure
â€¢	OSI: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical
â€¢	TCP/IP: Application, Transport, Internet, Network Interface
________________________________________
6. Transport Layer Protocols
â€¢	OSI: Only defines connection-oriented communication
â€¢	TCP/IP: Supports both TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connectionless)
________________________________________
7. Application Layer
â€¢	OSI: Divided into 3 layers â€“ Application, Presentation, Session
â€¢	TCP/IP: All 3 merged into a single Application layer
________________________________________
8. Model Type
â€¢	OSI: Conceptual/Theoretical
â€¢	TCP/IP: Practical/Implemented
